    "## I. Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "As the built in cameras becomes more and more common in cell phones and personal computers, images and videos are piling up. The desire to understand what is in these images and thus to apply this information to facilitate our daily life becomes more and more strong. Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field and provides a powerful solution in high-level image as well as videos understanding. \n",
    "\n",
    "Face recognition, a form of computer vision, which uses the spatial geometry of distinguishing features of the face to identify or to authenticate a person. Software using webcam acquired images automatically log on an authorized user has been developed for many years by several companies. Computer access control system based on face recognition is also provided by three well-known computer manufacturers. Although it is convenient (hand-free), its security caused by the relatively accuracy is one of the major concerns compared with other biometric recognition systems. Nevertheless, it is still considered as a good supplement for current available solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conventional face recognition pipeline consists of four stages which are face detection, face alignment, feature extraction and classification. One of the most import steps is the feature extraction. Conventional features include linear functions of the raw pixel values including Eigenface, Fisherface and Laplacianface. More recently, such linear features were replaced by hand-crafted features. Although hand-crafted features and metric learning achieve promising performance in constrained environment, the performance using these features degrades dramatically in unconstrained environments where face images conver complex and large intra-personal variations such as pose, illumination, expression and occusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, deep learning, in particular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has achieved very impressive results in face recognition. Unlike the conventional hand-crafted features, the CNN learning-based features are more robust to complex intra-personal variations. Indeed, the top three cases of face recognition in unconstrained environment (FRUE) reported on benchmark database LFW have been achieved by CNN. One of the advantages of CNN is that all processing layers have configurable parameters which can be learned from data, thus allievate the burden of manual feature design. However, the number of parameters in CNN can be millions if not billions. To learn such a large number of parameters, a very large training datasets are required. In many cases, collecting large datasets can be very costly or even an impossible task.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcomes the limitd size of datasets, two methods have been successfully applied to diverse recognition problems. For example, A 3D-aided face synthesis technique has been used for facial landmark detection and face recognition. Another commonly used technique is Data augmentation which applys mirroring, cropping, rotation, and scaling without changing semantic-level image label. [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06470.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "For security reasons, we are required to lock our computer whenever we leave our desk. When we come back to our desk, we have to unlock it. There are multiple ways to do it, for example, one can type in the password through keyboard or use an external device to read identification information through smart ID card, but none of them are hand-free process. So it is kind of annoying to repeat these locking/unlocking steps manually. For this project, I propose to develop an auto-facial recognition system. Specifically, this system uses the built-in camera in the computer to capture the image of a person in front of it. The captured image then is processed and routed to the auto-facial recognition system where a prediction will be made based on the input image. If the image is from an authorized person, a \"password\" message will be send to the computer so that it can unlock itself automatically, Otherwise it will not do anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, a CNN, the most recent deep learning face recognition method, is applied. Our goal is to achieve more accurate face recognition capability by carefully adjust the CNN architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify if a image from an authorized person, a 1:N authentication method is applied. Images of authorized person to use the computer are prepared by myself. Images of unauthorized users are collected from online ([LFW](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/)). Images are classified into \"authorized\" and \"unauthorized\" two categories and labeled with authorized (1) and unauthorized (0). The captured image will then be processed with OpenCV. Decision will be made based on the supervised learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "When trainning the model with CNN, the commonly used cross-entropy loss function is used.  \n",
    "$L_i=-\\log(\\frac{e^{f_yi}}{\\sum_j e^{f_i}})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Image data is devided into trainning, validation and testing three groups. To train the model, the keras python library is used with tensorflow as the backend. A supervised learning model is generated with the state of art machine learning algorithm convolutional neural networks (CNN). For the final classification, the softmax classifier function is used. To measure performance of the model, accuracy is used to evaluate the performance with the validation dataset and then test with testing data. The final model is further evaluate with 11 pieces of new images. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## II. Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce the labor, I have taken the advantage of the online resource. Images used for \"unauthorized\" category are downloaded from the website of computer vision lab at the University of Massachusetts (http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/). This image data set contains more than 13,000 images of faces collected from the web. Each face has been labeled with the name of the person pictured. The images are packed as a 173 MB gzipped tar file. The zipped file is unzipped with the 7-zip software downloaded from (http://www.7-zip.org/) and saved on a ../unauthorized folder. It has been known that there are some mismatches between the picture and the labeled name. This should not be a problem for the current project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Images used for \"authorized\" category are prepared by myself either using a cell phone or a built-in camera on the notebook. All image are taken at natural color with standard contrast. Images from these two sources have different size settings. Images manually taken are pre-trimmed with photoshop as 250 pixel x 250 pixel. Due to the time and labor limitation, total 333 images were prepared. To further enrich the \"authorized\" image pool, images were automatically derived from a set of self-recorded videos (480 pixel x 600 pixel) by using OpenCV. All videos are taken with the faces at approximate center position. Backgrounds are mostly from an indoor setting which mimicks the office environment. Images were picked every 2 to 10 frames depends on the variation of the background, illumination as well as the expression. Images were then cropped at [0:480, 60:540] and further resized as 250 x 250 x 3 format with INTER_AREA interpolation. The prepared images are saved on a ../authorized folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "For initial image data exploration, Ipython.display labrary and OpenCV (opencv.org) are used. Images are kept in good condition and can be shown with IPython.display library (see ImageExplore.ipynb file). All images shape is 250 x 250 x 3 with the size 187500. There are 10,843 images belong to \"authorized\" category and 13,233 images belong to \"unauthorized\" category. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw images from eith \"authorized\" or \"unauthorized\" categories are randomly picked for visualization. As we can see that images from both categories are propery displayed with normal color scheme (see ImageExplore.ipynb file).\n",
    "\n",
    "Images after processing and resizing were further visualized using pyplot image. All images were shown properly with expected size. Images data saved as pickle files were further converted back as image and can be also displayed normaly with propriate color scheme (see ImageRawdataProcessing.ipynb file).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithms and Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will need to discuss the algorithms and techniques you intend to use for solving the problem. You should justify the use of each one based on the characteristics of the problem and the problem domain. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Are the algorithms you will use, including any default variables/parameters in the project clearly defined?_\n",
    "- _Are the techniques to be used thoroughly discussed and justified?_\n",
    "- _Is it made clear how the input data or datasets will be handled by the algorithms and techniques chosen?_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benchmark\n",
    "In this section, you will need to provide a clearly defined benchmark result or threshold for comparing across performances obtained by your solution. The reasoning behind the benchmark (in the case where it is not an established result) should be discussed. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Has some result or value been provided that acts as a benchmark for measuring performance?_\n",
    "- _Is it clear how this result or value was obtained (whether by data or by hypothesis)?_\n",

    "## III. Methodology\n",
    "_(approx. 3-5 pages)_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce the data set size, raw images were further resized into a smaller format (80 pixel x 80 pixel x 3) with OpenCV with INTER_AREA intepolation. Images data for both categories were read into seperate numpy arrays and saved as pickle files named as authorized_image_data.pickle and unauthorized_image_data.pickle, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Image data then extracted from corresponding pickle files and corresponding labels were added for each image depends on which catgory it originates from. For example, a image from a \"authorized\" folder is labeled as 1 while a image from a \"unauthorized\" folder is labeled as 0. The image data is then converted into numpy arrays.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To train a surpvised model, data is randomly divided into training and testing groups with test size set as 0.25. For validation purpose, the training data set is further divided into training and validation groups with train size set as 0.7. All image data is presented as float32 data type and is centered by dividing by 255. Image label vectors were converted into binary matrics. Input shape for image data is 80 x 80 x 3 which represents 19200 features. \n",
    "\n",
    "In total, there are 24076 pieces of images with 45% are \"authorized\" images. After dividing, there are 12639 train samples, 5418 validation samples and 6019 test samples. All three groups have similar mean value (~ 0.42) and standard deviation (~ 0.27).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- _If the algorithms chosen require preprocessing steps like feature selection or feature transformations, have they been properly documented?_\n",
    "- _Based on the **Data Exploration** section, if there were abnormalities or characteristics that needed to be addressed, have they been properly corrected?_\n",
    "- _If no preprocessing is needed, has it been made clear why?_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we have selected the convolutional neural network (CNN) which has been proved particually useful for imaging classification and face recognition. The architecuture of CNN has 8 layers (denoted as L1, ..., L8). \n",
    "\n",
    "Input Image\n",

    "L8: Fully connected dense layer\n",
    "softmax loss layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Following each Maxpooling, a drop-out with probability of 0.25 is applied. For the fully-connected dense layer L7, a drop-out with probability of 0.5 is applied. The final full-connected dense layer takes the outputs of L7 as its input, produce outputs equal to 2 classes through a fully connected architecture, then passes these outputs throught a softmax function. With softmax loss layer, each input image is expected to have only one label.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make the deep neural network training more robust to facial pose variation, real time data augmentation is used. Specifically, I have randomly rotated image in the range 0 to 20 degree and randomly flipped image vertically. I have also set the channel_shift_range to 0.2 and fill_mode as \"nearest\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, the process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques that you implemented for the given data will need to be clearly documented. It should be abundantly clear how the implementation was carried out, and discussion should be made regarding any complications that occurred during this process. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Is it made clear how the algorithms and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data?_\n",
    "- _Were there any complications with the original metrics or techniques that required changing prior to acquiring a solution?_\n",
    "- _Was there any part of the coding process (e.g., writing complicated functions) that should be documented?_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial tuning has been focus on the epoch number, the problem associated with epoch number is that it takes longer time to test larger epoch number. so I have sticked to epoch number with no more than 40. Although as epoch number increase,we usually get better accuracy, it always over shot and miss the best epoch number. After the initial testing, I turn to early stoping method.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For batch size, I have tested range from 20 to 70 with Adam optimizer and eraly stoping. The result is that the accuracy of validation data set increased from 99.45% to 99.7% as the batch size increasing. However, when I used the model to test the new 22 images, models derived from batch size about 60-65 gives the best prediction although their validation accuracy is not the best. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have tested three different optimizers which are adam, sgd, and adamax. From my testing results, sgd always has the best accuracy for the test data set followed by adam. Adamax has the worest accuracy for test data set. However, adamax always has the best prediction for the new 22 images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will need to discuss the process of improvement you made upon the algorithms and techniques you used in your implementation. For example, adjusting parameters for certain models to acquire improved solutions would fall under the refinement category. Your initial and final solutions should be reported, as well as any significant intermediate results as necessary. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Has an initial solution been found and clearly reported?_\n",
    "- _Is the process of improvement clearly documented, such as what techniques were used?_\n",
    "- _Are intermediate and final solutions clearly reported as the process is improved?_\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, the final model and any supporting qualities should be evaluated in detail. It should be clear how the final model was derived and why this model was chosen. In addition, some type of analysis should be used to validate the robustness of this model and its solution, such as manipulating the input data or environment to see how the model’s solution is affected (this is called sensitivity analysis).
